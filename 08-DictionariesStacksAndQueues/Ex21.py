# Search he Internet and familiarise yourself with RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).
# Then, write a program that calculates RPN expressions. RPN can be conveniently
# evaluated using a stack structure. A user can enter by the keyboard any number,
# an operator (+ - * / ) or the equal sign (=).
#     a.	If the entered value is a number, push the number on to the stack
#     b.	If the entered value is an operator, pop two items from the top of the stack,
#         do the calculation, and push the result of the operation on to the stack.
#     c.	If the entered value is an equal sigh, pop the final result from the stack
#         and display the result of calculation.

# Using the program, calculate the value of RPN expressions:
# 	Expression						RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
# 	2 + 3 =							2 3 + =
# 	2 * (4 + 1) =					2 4 1 + * =
# 	(2 + 3) * ( 4 + 5) =			2 3 + 4 5 + * =
# 	8 / (3 + 1) * (3 - 2 + 4) = 	8 3 1 + / 3 2 â€“ 4 + * =
